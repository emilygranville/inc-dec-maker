        <h1>Increase/Decrease Maker</h1>
        <p>
            Use this tool to help you generate simple crochet instructions for increasing and decreasing.
            When increasing, put in your target stitch count. When decreasing, it will decrease to 6 stitches
            from the input number. Make sure that your number is a multiple of 6, as that is currently the
            only rate that is supported.
        </p>
