# Inc/Dec Maker

This is a simple website to simplify writing crochet patterns. Specifically, it automates the process of writing out the steps to increase from a magic circle to x number of stitches or to go from x number of stitches to closing the circle. This cannot do more complicated conversions, like skipping some row or going from (for example) 24 stitches to 60 by a rate of 6, however it is good for simple increases and decreases in crochet projects. I created this because I am sick of writing it out every single time I write my own steps since it is clearly fairly easy to automate the process.

Happy crocheting!
